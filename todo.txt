.Add -[c]reate optional command line argument that must
precede a valid file_path command line argument. In that 
case, kpass will prompt the user twice for the password
for the kepass file to be created. Inside the shell 
there will be no command 'create' (nor any 'open') as 
those commands would make it necessary provide some
file system navigation support, duplicating what is 
already provided by the os shell;

.Remove save command - all changes to the password 
records in the file should be immediately saved.

.Place the source files for the lib and for the kpass
console app in their own directories.
