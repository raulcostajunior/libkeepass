.Separate the keepass console from the libkeepass 
 (different repositories). libkeepass should have 
 unit tests (based on boost::test?);

.Convert KeePassFile to be RAII compliant - the
 initial header read operation from the ctor should
 be called from the method that reads the file 
 searching for a given set of entries (to be optimized
 when the library supports session oriented mode -
 cache decyphered contents from file given its path,
 the last update timestamp and the time for keeping
 decyphered contents stored in memory). The non session
 working mode - basic mode - will always go to the 
 "filesystem" (be it local, remote, cloud drive, ...)
 for retrieving contents.  

. Decode the file payload.

. Turn the keepass console into a Qt based GUI 
  application written in C++
