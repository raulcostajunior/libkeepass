# libkeepass
A C++ library for reading and writing safe password files in the Keepass format (`*.kbdx`).

Further information on the KeePass file format can be found at https://github.com/lgg/awesome-keepass#docs-and-articles.

`libkeepass` depends on the `botan` cryptography library (https://botan.randombit.net). The `cmake` find module for `botan` (https://bitbucket.org/sergiu/botan-cmake) has been embeeded into this project.
