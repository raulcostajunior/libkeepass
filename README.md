# libkeepass
A C++ library for reading and writing safe password files in the Keepass format (*.kbdx).

Includes `kpass`, a console based application that allows a user to interact with a safe password file. `kpass` primary goal is to be a reference client for the library and demo its features and capabilities. It can be a useful (and usable) application for some use cases, though (at least I hope so :)).

Further information on the KeePass file format can be found at https://github.com/lgg/awesome-keepass#docs-and-articles.
